As of October, there are 109 multi-category courier service licencees operating in Malaysia, ” said MCMC.Meanwhile, the process of drafting a new action plan by NPCIL will take three weeks, from Nov 2 to Nov 22, subject to the conditional movement control order (CMCO) by the government.“NPCIL results are important for this industry, which is at the core of e-commerce activities and digital economic development. The postal and courier industry faces various new challenges triggered by the technological boom, which has resulted in the merger of the logistics sector, e-commerce platform, e-hailing as well as financial transaction systems.“The last study on the postal and courier industry was conducted in 2009, ” said MCMC.Amec president Teong Teck Lean, who is also managing director and CEO of GD Express Carrier Bhd, lauded MCMC’s decision to freeze the application of new courier licences.“This is a good starting point and a positive move for the industry, as MCMC is also involving all stakeholders of the postal and courier industry, (from government agencies, courier service providers to the public), to work together to find the right formula to strengthen the industry.“By freezing applications, it will be easier to assess the current situation and decide on the necessary conditions to be implemented for the industry to self-regulate, ” said Teong, adding that the ultimate goal was for the postal and courier industry to be sustainable, reliable and efficient and be able to support the growth of e-commerce in Malaysia and the region.Given the sizeable figure of 109 licence holders, Teong felt that market consolidation could occur naturally, in time to come.As clearer regulations are outlined and sustainable measures put in place, he said such consolidations could then be carried out in a more professional and orderly manner, resulting in a win-win situation for all stakeholders.The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), along with the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, has announced a two-year moratorium on the issuance of new courier services licences, effective from Sept 14, 2020 until Sept 15, 2022.MCMC in a press statement explained that during the moratorium period, it will not accept any new application for licences from those wanting to provide courier services in all categories.The regulatory body said it will continue to process applications that it received prior to Sept 14, adding that as of Oct 2020, there are 109 licence holders for courier services operating in Malaysia under various categories.The decision to freeze new licensing was made in accordance with the Postal Services Act 2012 and can be revised at any time should the need arise, stated MCMC.The Postal Services Act 2012 stipulates that a person who provides postal services without a valid licence granted under Section 10 is considered to have committed an offense. Upon conviction, the person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding RM500,000 or a prison term of no more than five years, or both.The moratorium was implemented to allow the government and the postal and courier industries to formulate new plans to strengthen the sector as it faces numerous challenges due to rapid changes in technology and market trends.The move is in line with official calls made by the Association of Malaysian Express Carriers (AMEC), which represents 25 courier companies in Malaysia including Pos Malaysia Bhd, GD Express and City-Link Express, among others.A new action plan will be drafted through discussions at the National Postal and Courier Industry Laboratory (NPCIL) which is scheduled to take place on Nov 2 to 22.The last study on the country’s postal and courier services was carried out in 2009.MCMC explained that the outcome of the NPCIL discussions will be crucial for the courier industry that serves as the backbone of e-commerce activities and the digital economy in Malaysia.A full report with action plans to support the growth of the postal and courier industry will be made available on the MCMC website.THE fifth #MyCyberSale 2018 (www.mycybersale.my) from today till Friday is set to become Malaysia’s biggest ever online sale event since 2014, with over 1,200 merchants offering products and services in more than 20 categories. Organised by the National ICT Association of Malaysia (Pikom) and supported by Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), this online sale features products by regional and international brands such as Lazada, Shopee, Shopback, 28Mall, Malaysia Airlines, Qoo10, Hermo, Shopback, Coca Cola, Mead Johnson and Unilever.Shoppers will be spoilt for choice with over 20 retail categories to choose from, including electronics, fashion, baby and children, travel, health and beauty, home and living, food and beverage, wellness services, home appliances, and sporting equipment. “#MyCyberSale merchants have lined up attractive deals and items at hugely discounted prices for consumers to take advantage of. “This is the time to grab fantastic travel deals, your favourite tech gadgets, and shop for festive holiday gifts and year-end parties,” said Pikom chairman Ganesh Kumar Bangah.Almost two-thirds of Malaysian Internet users are online shoppers and #MyCyberSale 2018 has the potential to reach over 13.9 million online shoppers here, he added.Pikom is confident that #MyCyberSale can surpass the targeted RM370mil in GMV – total revenue generated during the five-day sale period before making an allowance for discounts.In line with its theme “Driving Growth Through Omni Channel Commerce”, #MyCyberSale is held to encourage SMEs and micro-enterprises to adopt an omnichannel approach for their businesses to reduce dependency on social media private messaging sales, said Ganesh.#MyCyberSale will be held annually between National Day and Malaysia Day, he added.MDEC chief executive officer Datuk Yasmin Mahmood said #MyCyberSale helps local SMEs take their rightful place in the burgeoning e-commerce arena and place Malaysia as a regional e-commerce powerhouse.“Initiatives such as #MyCyberSale are aligned with a most fundamental objective of the National Strategic eCommerce Roadmap, which is to accelerate adoption of e-commerce (in Malaysia). “Our SMEs and microenterprises will benefit greatly from these proactive steps to boost online trade,” she said.According to the Statistics Department, e-commerce is expected to grow from 10.6% in 2016 to 20.8% by 2020. With one of the highest Internet penetrations in South-East Asia at 85.7% and mobile penetration at almost 140%, Malaysia has become one of the fastest growing emerging e-commerce emerging markets in the region. More than 600 merchants are expected to ship orders to China, United Arab Emirates, United States and other countries in Europe and South-East Asia.With the favourable ringgit currency rate expected to attract more overseas customers to #MyCyberSale 2018, Pikom is confident that the targeted RM50mil export revenue would be achieved, said Ganesh, who was speaking at the launch of #MyCyberSale 2018 that was attended by more than 350 guests, in Kuala Lumpur.#MyCyberSale 2018 online sale event has become a catalyst for merchants in Malaysia to be part of the e-commerce ecosystem and contribute to the domestic and export e-commerce revenue. In 2017, #MyCyberSale attracted 1,007 merchants, generating RM311mil in GMV, with RM39mil in export revenue. #MyCyberSale 2018 drew strong support from more than 100 leading corporate and retail brands in the private sector, including Pinnacle Partners Commerce.Asia, Fusionex, Mastercard and Lazada; Premier Partners Mobiversa, SAP Malaysia, Shippop, Shopback, CapFiX and y5zone Malaysia; Gold Partners iPay88 and Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) and Silver Partners SF Express, eGHL, GDex, LWE, SF Express, World First and City-Link Express. The event also attracted initiative and marketing partners as well as lucky draw sponsors.“This is the second year that Pikom is helming #MyCyberSale and I am confident it is on a progressive road to become a fully self-sustainable event as more than 62% of the event this year is funded by the private sector compared with 40% last year,” Ganesh added.'}, {'id': 'poslaju', 'link': 'Pos%20Laju', 'listLinks': ['https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/letters/2021/04/17/where-is-my-parcel-mr-postman', 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/04/10/serve-your-two-years-reckless-biker-told', 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/02/05/retiree-duped-out-of-nearly-rm1mil-in-macau-scam'], 'contents': 'I AM a shareholder of Pos Malaysia Bhd, hence I would like to highlight my views regarding the persistent woes of its customers over the late delivery of parcels by this service provider.Just browse through Facebook and you can see the numerous complaints about its inefficiency.Many Pos Malaysia CEOs have come and gone, but there seems to be no progress in tackling the problem despite its promise of transformation.As an example, I sent four parcels at the same time on April 5. The tracking numbers are CD323073724MY, CD323073741MY, CD323073738MY and CD323073755MY. Three of the parcels are on their way, but the one with the tracking number CD323073724MY is still “quarantined” at the Batu Gajah Post Office for no reason whatsoever.This is the third time I am experiencing such a delay. After complaining to Ask Pos, the problem was rectified for the first two delays.But when I complained about this recent case to Ask Pos, I was told to wait for a month and lodge another complaint if the parcel was not delivered by then.Unfortunately, no reply was given to my e-mail to Pos Malaysia headquarters requesting that it looks deeply into this matter and search for the parcel, coupled with an appeal for it to improve its services and thereby raise its image in the eyes of its customers.If Pos Malaysia cannot meet our expectations, I suggest that it closes down Pos Laju and becomes an agent to other reputable courier companies, which can use its vast network of post offices and resources. These companies could then contribute part of their profits to Pos Malaysia.The present staff manning the complaints section can be deployed to other important divisions within the organisation.MOHD FAROQUEBatu Gajah, PerakPUTRAJAYA: A 24-year-old man has been sentenced to two years’ jail for riding his motorcycle recklessly, leading to the death of another motorcyclist four years ago.This was after the Court of Appeal three-man panel led by Justice Suraya Othman dismissed Muhammad Mustaqim Khairudin’s application to get leave to pursue his appeal in the appellate court as he did not raise any questions of law.Justice Suraya, who presided with Justices Abu Bakar Jais and Ghazali Cha, issued a warrant of committal for Muhammad Mustaqim to serve his jail sentence from yesterday.Muhammad Mustaqim was on bail pending the hearing of his application.Under the law, Muhammad Mustaqim was required to first get leave before he could proceed with his appeal in the Court of Appeal as his case originated from the Magistrate’s Court.The Kangar Magistrate’s Court found Muhammad Mustaqim guilty of the offence and sentenced him to two years’ jail and fined him RM6,000. He lost his appeal in the High Court.According to the charge, Muhammad Mustaqim, who was then a student, had recklessly ridden his motorcycle resulting in the death of 17-year-old Akmal Azrizal Anour in front of Pos Laju in Jalan Kangar, Padang Besar, Kangar, Perlis at about 10.10pm on March 8,2017. — BernamaPETALING JAYA: In yet another Macau scam case, a 74-year-old woman lost almost RM1mil.On Sept 25 last year, the retiree received a call from a person claiming to be from Pos Laju’s headquarters.Petaling Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Nik Ezanee Mohd Faisal said according to the victim, she received a call telling her there was a package for her containing a MyKad and three ATM cards.The suspect then connected the call to another person who claimed to be an officer from the Sabah police headquarters.“The ‘policeman’ claimed she was involved in money laundering, ” said ACP Nik Ezanee.He added that the call was then transferred to a third person identifying himself as “Si Wan”, who said the victim would be detained if she did not cooperate.“Out of fear, the victim revealed her bank account details over the phone, ” he said.The victim then transferred RM833,000 from her Tabung Haji account to her bank account on Oct 1.“The so-called ‘Si Wan’ then asked the victim to hand over her ATM cards, purportedly for auditing purposes, on Oct 5.“The victim was instructed to place the cards in a mailbox at a shopping mall.“This was done the following day, ” said ACP Nik Ezanee.The victim subsequently transferred another RM159,000 to her other bank account in several transactions, he added.The victim only realised she had been duped and lodged a police report on Feb 3, four months after first talking to the scammers.ACP Nik Ezanee warned that Macau scam syndicates were targeting senior citizens.He advised those who received such calls not to be fooled.“If you receive such calls, check with your family members or call the police, ” he said.Macau scams often start with a call from someone claiming to be an officer from a bank, government or law enforcement agency.The scammer will then claim the victim owes money or has an unpaid fine, often with an hour or less, to settle the payment or face “dire consequences”.

With supply chains disrupted, one way out for businesses was stocking goods ahead of time, says Tasco group chief executive officer, Andy Lee Wan Kai.“We have witnessed a surge in demand in all our business segments, but especially in international airfreight and sea freight segments, as well as our contract logistics business.There’s also an increase in requests for warehouse space due to abnormality within the global supply chain and also the need to keep higher buffer stock to ensure non-interruption of production due to Covid-19 risk factors, ” he tells StarBizweek. He says that during the first movement control order (MCO) from March 18- May 3,2020, there was strong demand for cold-chain and convenience retail logistics to cater for the handling of food and pharmaceutical goods. This mitigated the impact of the MCO.“Moving from that period, as our customers re-started their operations, our business volume experienced a surge resulting in a V-shape recovery from the month of June 2020 onwards until to-date, ” Lee adds, pointing out that the group’s top line expanded some 30% from organic growth year-on-year in FY21.“With work-from-home initiatives becoming the new norm, we think the demand for logistics services will stay, ” says Tiong Nam Logistics Holdings Bhd executive director Victor Ong.Tasco is involved in contract logistics, air freight forwarding, trucking, ocean freight forwarding, and cold supply chain logistics, where it is a leading player with about 35% market share.Last month, the group announced it is expanding to East Malaysia and Kalimantan area via the acquisition of Hypercold Logistic Sdn Bhd, which has the largest cold chain warehouse capacity as well as eight temperature controlled trucks in Sabah.The acquisition, slated to be completed in the second quarter of this year, will raise Tasco’s capacity to 53,000-56,000 pallets – cementing its lead position in the transportation of temperature sensitive products.Lee says, while the group is on the look-out for mergers & acquisitions, there is nothing concrete at the moment.Where organic growth is concerned, it plans to invest around RM400mil over the next five years to cater for its next phase of growth.“These expansion plans will be more focused on warehousing capacity at strategic locations that we have identified as well as increase our vehicle fleet for port haulage business, ” says Lee.The issue is can the pandemic-fueled boost last when things eventually normalise?For now, the lockdown rules are still not relaxed completely and the fear of outdoor shopping and virus transmission remains.Post-pandemic, players in the industry are confident that the digital format of doing business is here to stay.GDEX MD and CEO Teong Teck Lean says even as Covid-19 exacts a bitter toll on the economy, it is catalyzing digital transformation across business models and channels from banks to professional services like doctors.While the shift from offline to online, in particular for individual shopping, is becoming a habit for consumers, the workplace has also transformed.“With work-from-home initiatives becoming the new norm, we think the demand for logistics services will stay, ” says Tiong Nam Logistics Holdings Bhd executive director Victor Ong.Ong adds that the company is also seeing an increasing number of customers outsourcing non-core logistics and distribution services to total logistics solution providers like Tiong Nam.“This has been an ongoing trend as companies strive to reduce cost, improve efficiencies, and focus on their core competencies, ” he says.Tiong Nam, which has a presence in more than 20 strategic locations across six countries in South-East Asia, is currently expanding to meet future needs and allocated about RM200mil in capital expenditure for warehouse expansion for the financial years ending March 31,2021 to March 31,2024.The first phase of the expansion encompasses the ongoing construction of a new warehouse in Senai, Johor, as well as upcoming ones in Pelabuhan Tanjung Pelepas, Johor and Shah Alam, Selangor.“Upon the targeted completion of these facilities by the end of FY22, the group’s total warehouse capacity would stand at 6.4 million sq. ft., growing from 6.0 million sq. ft. currently, ” he tells StarBizweek. The group, which recorded a 260% jump in net profit to RM6.4mil for the third quarter ended Dec 31,2020, would also be expanding its regional facilities, and plans to build a new warehouse in Senoko, Singapore in 2022 and may consider further expansions across its regional network if there is market demand.At ACE Market-listed Tri-Mode System (M) Bhd, its group MD Datuk Hew Han Seng says the company has been handling more export cargo and saw greater demand for its air-freight services segment in 2020.The company, which offers sea and air freight, container haulage, warehousing, and transportation services, is also gearing up for growth.At the end of March, Tri-Mode moved to its new 12-acre headquarter and distribution hub in Pulau Indah Industrial Park where it has additional spaces for future expansion.The hub houses a 85,000 sq ft, of warehouse built-up space. Together with third-party logistics services, Hew is optimistic the warehouse segment will generate a new source of income from financial year ending Dec 31,2021.The pandemic is also seeing logistics companies evolving with trends.GDEX Bhd says providing more comprehensive digital solutions is an area of focus, while strengthening the current core business to emerge as a pure-play last-mile delivery company with a regional presence.Its MD and CEO Teong Teck Lean says even as Covid-19 exacts a bitter toll on the economy, it is catalyzing digital transformation across business models and channels from banks to professional services like doctors.“Customers are more digitally-savvy and seek seamless connectivity between e-commerce platforms and other social commerce platforms with logistics fulfilment services too, he says.Interestingly, the pandemic has also brought about collaborations between competing companies.Last month, GDEX and Tasco inked a memorandum of understanding to enhance logistics delivery services, riding on each party’s strength.This is perhaps a signal that logistics companies are not only adapting, but ready to embrace the rapidly changing behaviour toward online channels, which are likely to stick post-pandemic.KUALA LUMPUR: GD Express Carrier Bhd (GDEX) will collaborate with DOC2US and Alpro Pharmacy to implement secure and real-time tracking of medication delivery.DOC2US, which is a telemedicine provider approved by the Health Ministry to provide digitally signed e-prescription services, said the strategic tie-up would enable the group to provide a one-stop solution for patients; from digital healthcare and pharmaceutical supplies to logistics.“This strategic collaboration between DOC2US, Alpro Pharmacy, and GDEX will not only enhance our back-end processes and productivity, but most importantly, provides a better patient experience when it comes to medication delivery services, ” chief executive officer of DOC2US, Raymond Choy, said in a statement.“We are confident of a safer provision of healthcare service, which is now more personal yet professional. In turn, we are able to set a higher standard in medication delivery in Malaysia, ” he added.Once patients receive the e-prescription from doctors at DOC2US after consultation, pharmacists at Alpro Pharmacy will then fill the prescription, the companies said.For patients who opt for doorstep delivery of their medication, they can track their barcoded medication shipments from GDEX in real time, to better time their availability in receiving their medication, it added.“Our courier staff have been internally trained to handle the delivery and manage the storage of medication.“Coupled with our barcoded tracking system, we are able to ensure that the right medication is delivered to the right patient, and most importantly, in the right condition, ” GDEX chief operating officer Caren Chong said.Choy said there were currently more than 300 authorised pharmacies adopting the group’s electronic prescribing/dispensing solutions and it was targeting to onboard 1,000 pharmacy outlets this year to further shorten the delivery time nationwide.“Gradually, we will also offer this seamless medication delivery service to all of our authorised pharmacies this year.“At present, we offer same day delivery for minor ailments in seven major areas – the Klang Valley, Penang, Seremban, Melaka, Johor Baru, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching, ” he said.'}, {'id': 'jnt', 'link': 'J%26T%20express', 'listLinks': ['https://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2019/06/30/murals-created-in-school', 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2019/06/30/more-time-to-teach', 'https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2019/06/29/sudan-military-issues-warning-to-opposition-over-planned-protest-rally'], 'contents': 'IN a continuous effort to create enriched learning environments for students, R.E.A.L Schools and Nippon Paint Malaysia Group have collaborated for the creation of six murals at R.E.A.L Schools Cheras Campus.The mural project, which took three weeks to complete, is part of R.E.A.L Schools’ effort to create a stimulating and conducive environment for students, as well as to pave the way for them to further develop their creative talents. The murals are also testament to R.E.A.L Schools Cheras Campus’ dedication in the field of arts and design, where educators and students alike are constantly encouraged to push their creative boundaries. The murals were inspired by those in Penang and Ipoh, which became popular with both foreign and local tourists. R.E.A.L Education Group CEO Dr Goh Chee Leong said: “Through our collaboration with Nippon Paint, we have been able to provide our educators and students with an opportunity to push their creative boundaries through the painting of the murals.”“This is in line with our vision to provide REAL education for the REAL world, and this involves preparing our students for the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions, which include skills relating to design, digital education, and the performing arts. “And to add to that, we don’t need to go all the way to Penang or Ipoh to experience these creative 3D murals!” he added.Nippon Paint Malaysia Group general manager Gladys Goh said the company understands the importance of students developing a sense of innovation and creative thinking. “This is why we constantly inspire them to express themselves and be adventurous by exploring through colours, and create ideas that are outstanding and push conventional boundaries. “Through our end-to-end coatings solutions, which cover all types of surfaces, we are able to work with R.E.A.L Schools to bring the 3D mural art to life on various wall surfaces. “Our aim is also to create a vibrant environment for students to study and interact in,” she said.  Dr Goh added that R.E.A.L Schools Cheras Campus always prides itself for its excellence in arts and design, and this is why the campus has been selected to drive this particular collaboration. “R.E.A.L Schools is committed to providing students with an avenue to develop their natural talents and further discover their potential along the way, which the students have been able to do through this collaboration. “At R.E.A.L Schools, the learning journey has always been focused on nurturing and transforming students through active learning,” he added. The murals at R.E.A.L Schools Cheras Campus were coated with Nippon Paint’s Weatherbond exterior range, which provides protection against the harsh climate in Malaysia. This marks the second collaboration between Nippon Paint and R.E.A.L Education Group. In 2015, Nippon Paint repainted the R.E.A.L Kids Bukit Jelutong centre.WORKING conditions for teachers in Singapore appear to have improved, with educators putting in fewer hours each week now than they did five years ago. This is because they are spending less time on administrative work and marking, which also gives them more time to teach, according to a new global survey.However, they still work longer hours – 46 per week – than their overseas counterparts, who clock an average of 39 hours a week and also spend more time in the classroom than teachers here, according to the Teaching and Learning International Survey (Talis) released on June 19.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study, which polled 260,000 teachers worldwide, found that Singapore teachers worked two hours fewer each week than the 48 they reported in the earlier Talis study in 2013.This makes teachers in Singapore the seventh most hardworking in the world, down from third in the 2013 survey. Japan’s teachers came up top with 56 hours, followed by Kazakhstan and Alberta, Canada.The five-yearly survey of teachers across the world is conducted by the OECD to help countries review policies to improve their teaching profession and provide information on teacher education and professional development, their workload, instructional beliefs and teaching practices.A total of 48 education systems joined the latest study, and this is Singapore’s second time participating.About 3,300 teachers and 167 principals in Singapore from all 157 secondary schools and a random selection of 12 private schools took the online questionnaire from September to October 2017.Teachers in Singapore spent most of their time on actual teaching, reporting 18 hours per week, up by an hour from 2013. However, this is still less than the OECD average of 21 hours.They also reported a drop in the time spent on administrative work, from 5.3 hours in 2013 to 3.8 hours last year, and marking, from 8.7 hours in 2013 to 7.5 hours last year.The OECD averages for administrative work and marking were 2.7 hours and 4.2 hours, respectively.Lesson preparation for Singapore teachers took up 7.2 hours last year, down from 8.4 hours in 2013.Director-general of education Wong Siew Hoong said that the reduction of two hours in teachers’ workload can be attributed largely to their having less administrative work.“This is indeed gratifying to know, because the ministry has put in quite a number of initiatives to reduce teachers’ administrative workload, for example, in terms of attendance marking, and in terms of consent forms that are necessary, when they take students on learning journeys,” he said.The Talis survey also found more Singapore teachers are using innovative methods in their classrooms to teach and assess students.The Education Ministry said that more teachers express confidence in using various assessment approaches to evaluate students’ understanding of concepts and topics taught. They now use assessment strategies such as observation, quizzes and group work, and not just tests and examinations alone.The ministry noted that 76% of teachers felt they were able to use a repertoire of assessment methods, up from 72% in 2013. And 77% provide written feedback on students’ work frequently, compared with 72% in 2013.In Singapore, as well as across the countries surveyed such as Finland and Japan, more than seven in 10 teachers spent time on fundamentals such as presenting content clearly, applying everyday examples from real life to knowledge, and telling students to follow classroom rules.But compared with five years ago, more teachers are also adopting learning approaches that involve higher-order thinking such as collaboration and critical thinking.Some 45% of Singapore teachers get their students to form small groups to come up with solutions to problems, up from 33% in 2013. And 43% let students use information and communications technology for projects or class work, up from 30% before. More of them – 34% – also give students projects that require at least a week to complete, compared with 27% previously.The ministry said that recent announcements to scrap some mid-year examinations in favour of more time on other forms of assessment will continue to encourage teachers to try more creative teaching methods.“It is heartening to know that our teachers are increasingly deploying pedagogies that help our students apply knowledge to become deeper learners. “They are learning not just content, but applying it to global contexts, to solve real-world problems,” said Wong.The Talis report also said teaching was the first career choice for seven in 10 Singapore teachers, and nearly all of them cited being able to influence the development of young children and people, and contributing to society, as reasons for joining the profession.Teachers in Singapore are also more qualified and well-trained than those abroad. Almost all – 96% – of the schools here have a mentoring programme for teachers, compared with 64% of schools across OECD countries.Nearly all teachers and principals also have taken part in some professional development, such as attending courses, peer learning and information sharing with other teachers.Orchid Park Secondary School principal Shawal Hussin, 50, said schools are always looking for ways to free up time so teachers can “concentrate on their bread and butter, which is teaching”.“In the past, teachers used to do everything, but in the last few years, duties like booking buses for excursions and liaising with vendors are done by admin staff. “We also try to merge similar programmes and have more collaboration across departments so one activity can meet more learning aims,” he said.“A lot is expected of teachers here – they handle co-curricular activities and character education – but it’s part of the job and new teachers are also given some time to ease into it.” — The Straits Times/Asia News NetworkKHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan\\'s ruling military council said on Saturday that a coalition of protest and opposition groups would bear the responsibility for any loss of life or damage resulting from a protest march planned for Sunday.The Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition has called for a million people to take to the streets of the capital, Khartoum, to press its demands for the military council to cede power to civilians.The generals and the opposition movement have been wrangling for weeks over how to manage a transition towards elections following the military\\'s ouster of long-time President Omar al-Bashir on April 11.\"We warn of the seriousness of the crisis our country is going through,\" the council said in a statement carried by state news agency SUNA.\"We also hold the Forces for Freedom and Change fully responsible for any spirit that is lost in this march, or any damage or harm to citizens or state institutions,\" it added.The deputy head of the Transitional Military Council (TMC), General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, warned of \"vandals\" and a \"concealed agenda\" that he suggested might seek to take advantage of the march.Direct talks between the council and the FFC stalled and then collapsed altogether when security forces stormed a protest sit-in in central Khartoum on June 3, killing dozens.The sit-in had become the focal point of protests against Bashir and the military council.Mediators led by the African Union (AU) and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have since been trying to broker a return to direct talks between the two sides.On Friday, the military council said a proposal submitted by the AU and Ethiopia received on June 27 was suitable for the resumption of talks with the opposition.The opposition had supported an earlier Ethiopian proposal before the military council said the AU and Ethiopian efforts needed to be merged.Separately on Saturday, the Sudanese Professionals\\' Association (SPA) said the head of a teachers\\' committee and a leading member of the FFC had been detained.The military council did not immediately comment.\"We urge the international community to demand their immediate release. This move by the TMC is highly detrimental to confidence building at this crucial time,\" said the SPA, which is part of the FFC and spearheaded the anti-Bashir protests.The European Union on Friday said the Sudanese people\\'s right to protest and express their views \"is key\" and supported the AU-Ethiopian mediation efforts.

This malicious software program is spread via a link in an SMS telling users they’ve missed a package delivery. In the UK, Germany and Spain, this spyware is causing concern among authorities.Make sure you double (or triple) check before clicking any links on your cellphone. This advice can’t be repeated enough, but malware attacks, seeking to steal user data are on the rise, and they’re increasingly discreet and cunning.In the case of Flubot, the spyware is installed when users receive a text message alerting them to a missed package delivery, and poses as a parcel-tracking application (like DHL, FedEx or UPS).When a user clicks on the link to download the app, going back can prove tricky. In fact, the program can instantly steal passwords and other data from smartphones. Plus, it spreads like an infection, accessing user contacts to in turn send them scam messages, creating an almost infinite cycle of malicious SMS.To escape its grips, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre recommends that users who click the link to download the application should perform a factory reset as soon as possible.While iOS users are less affected (the spyware doesn’t exist for iOS, although the scam website could still steal personal data), Android users are specifically at risk. When someone using an Android smartphone clicks on the link in the SMS, they are directed to a page “explaining” how to install the supposed package tracking application, using something called an APK file.APK files are a way of installing Android apps without using the secure Google Play Store. By default, these applications are blocked for security reasons, but the scam webpage features instructions on how to authorise installation. iPhone users cannot install Android APK files.The network operator Vodafone UK said that millions of messages had already been sent, across all networks. “We believe this current wave of Flubot malware SMS attacks will gain serious traction very quickly, and it's something that needs awareness to stop the spread,” said a Vodafone spokesperson.SCAM TEXT ALERTIf you receive a text message that looks like the one below:IGNORE: Do not click any links.REPORT: Report it by forwarding to 7726.DELETE: Remove the text from your phone. pic.twitter.com/ailKcmXYh4A criminal network of international scaleBut this spyware isn’t new. Back in March, police in Spain broke up a criminal network in Barcelona. After these arrests, other users of the program launched malware campaigns in Germany, the UK and Japan.In fact, for the authorities, this is a particularly tricky problem to solve, as the spyware isn’t used by just one network. Instead, it’s made available by its creators, then “distributed” to malicious individuals.This is what is known as a MaaS (Malware as a Service), allowing anyone to pay to make use of malware programs. The spyware appears to be regularly updated and is being readied for future attacks, notably in countries like Italy, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Poland.In the UK and in Germany, cybersecurity and IT security services have issued alerts warning users about fraudulent SMS messages. According to certain experts, Flubot is likely to continue to spread at a sustained rate, rapidly moving from one country to another. – AFP RelaxnewsSINGAPORE: Police have uncovered a new scam in which delivery personnel from parcel and food delivery companies are the targets.Under this scam variant, the victims would first receive a cash-on-delivery order via their company’s delivery app, the police said in a statement on Tuesday (April 13).On the pretext of making payment for the delivery, the scammer would then ask for the victims’ mobile phone number via the app, claiming that it was for the purpose of transferring funds to the victims via PayLah!.The victims would then receive a one-time password (OTP) and be prompted to log in to their PayLah! account and key in the OTP in order to receive delivery payments.Shortly thereafter, the victims would receive a notification that their PayLah! account had been linked to a Google Pay account.Upon reaching the delivery location, the victims would find no one there to receive the item. Subsequently, unknown transactions will be done using the victims’ bank accounts.The police advised members of the public to always confirm transactions one is making before keying in the one-time password.They also advised people to inform their banks immediately if their PayLah! accounts were linked to other accounts without their authorisation, and to report any fraudulent transactions to the bank immediately.In a separate statement on Tuesday (April 13), the police also noted an increase in non-banking-related phishing scams involving spoofed e-mails and text messages related to parcel delivery.Victims of such phishing scams would receive spoofed e-mails or text messages purportedly sent from a delivery company such as SingPost or DHL.These phishing e-mails and text messages would usually prompt the victims to check the status of their parcel delivery by clicking on the URL link included in the e-mails and text messages.Upon clicking the URL links, victims would be redirected to fraudulent websites, where they would be required to provide their credit or debit card details and an OTP.In some cases, the victims would receive a notification that their credit or debit cards had been linked to an Apple Pay account.Most of the victims only realised that they had been scammed when they discovered that unauthorised transactions were made using their credit or debit cards, said the police.The police urge members of the public not to click on URL links provided in unsolicited e-mails and text messages, and always verify the authenticity of information received with the official website or sources.They also advise people to contact their card issuing bank immediately if they received an OTP and did not make any online transactions, and to always verify the merchant details indicated in the OTP text message or notification before providing it.The police cautioned against keying in the OTP on the payment page if not making the transaction, and never to disclose personal or Internet banking details and OTPs to anyone. – The Straits Times (Singapore)/Asia News NetworkKUALA LUMPUR: MAB kargo Sdn Bhd (MASkargo), the air cargo logistics arm of Malaysia Airlines, is eyeing for a higher market share following its newly-formed strategic partnership with international courier DHL Express (M) Sdn Bhd (DHL).MASkargo chief executive officer Ibrahim Mohamed Salleh said the company’s air freight market share in Malaysia currently stood at between 40% and 50%.“This is one of the potential (growth) areas that we are looking at because this service is very innovative, and will grow exponentially, ” he told reporters after signing the partnership agreement with DHL yesterday. — Bernama\"}]\n"
